# Thing from the Future
This is an adaptation of the [Situation Labs game Thing from the Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/) to be played together online. The cards are used as prompts to create a story about an object from the future. You write your own story using the ideas from the cards.

## How to Play
The cards are chosen online, but you also need something to write with and write on for your story.

### Starting the Game
Only one player needs have their browser open and share their screen with the rest of the players.

Press the DEAL CARDS button to choose four cards for the round. When everyone is ready to play press the START GAME button. The timer will start counting down to 2 minutes. When the buzzer sounds that is the end of the writing time. Everyone then reads their stories to each other, the winner is the person who has written the best story, as decided by the players.

Press deal again for a new set of cards.

### The Cards
There are four types of cards in The Thing From The Future: Society, Context, Object, and Mood. Each round, one player will generate a four-card creative prompt containing one of each kind of card. Based on this prompt, players will imagine a thing from the future.

#### SOCIETY CARDS
SOCIETY cards broadly describe different kinds of possible societies. 
        These cards contain two kinds of information. The main (top) text of 
        each society card specifies one of four generic images of alternative 
        futures for players to imagine: Grow, Collapse, Discipline, 
        or Transform. Underneath that is how far ahead in the future it is from now.

##### Grow
Grow is a kind of future in which everything and everyone keeps climbing: population, production, consumption.

##### Collapse
Collapse is a kind of future in which 
life as we know it has fallen – or is falling – apart.

##### Discipline
Discipline is a kind of future in which things are carefully managed by concerted coordination, perhaps top-down or perhaps collaboratively.

##### Transform
Transform</b> is a kind of future in which a profound historical transition 
has occurred, whether spiritual or technological in nature.

#### CONTEXT CARDS
CONTEXT cards describe contexts, places, and topic areas. In a 
        completed prompt, the context card describes where – physically or 
        conceptually – the thing from the future might be found.

#### OBJECT CARDS
OBJECT cards describe the basic form of the thing from the future.

#### MOOD CARDS
MOOD cards describe emotions that the thing from the future 
        might evoke in an observer from the present.
